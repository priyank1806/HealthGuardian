# HealthGuardian
**Inspiration**
The inspiration came from the need to provide a user-friendly solution for early disease detection, mental health support, and personalized health recommendations to improve lives.

**What it does**
Health Guardian detects various diseases, offers a mental health chatbot, and provides tailored medicine, diet, and workout recommendations for better health management.

**How we built it**
We used machine learning models on platforms like Jupyter Notebook and integrated them with a responsive website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All the Disease Detection models have been Deployed through Streamlit. Mental Health Chatbot and the two recommendation Systems are coded on the platform "PyCharm".

**Challenges we ran into**
Integrating machine learning models into the website and ensuring a smooth user interface were the major challenges, along with optimizing the recommendation systems.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
Weâ€™re proud of successfully combining advanced ML models with a clean, user-friendly design and creating a system that supports both physical and mental health.

**What we learned**
We gained hands-on experience in integrating ML with web technologies and learned the importance of user-centric design in health applications.

**What's next for Health Guardian**
We plan to expand the disease detection capabilities and also more diseases to detect like Tuberculosis, Cancer, etc, improve chatbot interactivity, and add features like real-time health monitoring for a more comprehensive health solution.
